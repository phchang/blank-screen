# Blank Screen

Blank Screen is a simple utility that cycles through various colors upon
double-tap. I initially created this to verify screen abnormalities on my
iPhone. Some parts of the screen are consistently obscured, such as the top left
where the signal strength indicator and carrier information is located.
